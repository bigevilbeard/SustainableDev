This is a high-level overview of a typical process to set up a machine learning workflow using AWS services. In this scenario, we are using Amazon EMR for data processing, Amazon SageMaker for model training, a Flask app for integration with SageMaker, and AWS Lambda with API Gateway for deploying the Flask app serverless. Here is a breakdown of each step:

1. **Prepare the training data and upload it to an S3 bucket:**
   - Gather and clean the data that will be used for training. This can involve data cleaning, preprocessing, and feature engineering.
   - Upload the cleaned data to an Amazon S3 bucket to make it accessible for further processing.

2. **Use Amazon EMR to process and clean the data:**
   - Set up an Amazon EMR cluster to efficiently process the data at scale. EMR is a service that allows for big data processing using tools like Apache Spark or Hadoop.
   - Run data processing jobs on the EMR cluster to clean and preprocess the training data.

3. **Use Amazon SageMaker to train a machine learning model on the processed data:**
   - Use Amazon SageMaker to build, train, and deploy machine learning models. SageMaker provides a managed platform for end-to-end ML workflows.
   - Train a machine learning model on the processed data using SageMaker's built-in algorithms or custom scripts.

4. **Save the trained model to S3:**
   - Save the trained machine learning model to an S3 bucket for easy retrieval and deployment.

5. **Deploy the trained SageMaker model as a prediction endpoint/REST API:**
   - Deploy the trained model as a SageMaker endpoint, which provides a REST API for making predictions.
   - With the SageMaker endpoint in place, you can send new data to the model for making real-time predictions.

6. **Build a Flask app to interact with the SageMaker endpoint:**
   - Develop a Flask application that can send project details to the SageMaker endpoint for prediction.
   - The Flask app can act as a middleware between the user interface and the SageMaker model.

7. **Deploy the Flask app as a serverless application using AWS Lambda and API Gateway:**
   - Deploy the Flask app serverless on AWS Lambda, which allows you to run code without provisioning or managing servers.
   - Configure API Gateway to handle incoming HTTP requests and route them to the Lambda function running the Flask app.

By following these steps, you can create an end-to-end machine learning workflow on AWS, from data processing to model training, deployment, and integration with a serverless Flask app. Make sure to consider security best practices, cost optimization, and performance considerations at each stage of the process.
